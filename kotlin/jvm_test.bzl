      features: A list of enabled features, see go/be#common.features.
      javacopts: Additional flags to pass to javac if used.
      plugins: Java annotation processors to run at compile-time.
      runtime_deps: A list of runtime dependencies.
      srcs: A list of sources to compile.
      tags: A list of string tags passed to generated targets.
