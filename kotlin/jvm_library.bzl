    """This rule compiles Kotlin (and Java) sources into a Jar file.

    Most Java-like libraries
    and binaries can depend on this rule, and this rule can in turn depend on Kotlin and
    Java libraries. This rule supports a subset of attributes supported by `java_library`.
    In addition to documentation provided as part of this rule, please also refer to their
    documentation as part of `java_library`.

    Args:
      name: Name of the target.
      srcs: A list of sources to compile.
      common_srcs: A list of common sources to compile for multi-platform projects.
      data: A list of data dependencies.
      exports: A list of targets to export to rules that depend on this one.
      deps: A list of dependencies. NOTE: kt_library targets cannot be added here (yet).
      runtime_deps: Libraries to make available to the final binary or test at runtime only.
      proguard_specs: Proguard specifications to go along with this library.
      plugins: Java annotation processors to run at compile-time.
      exported_plugins: https://bazel.build/reference/be/java#java_plugin rules to export to direct
        dependencies.
      resources: A list of data files to include in the Jar, see
        https://bazel.build/reference/be/java#java_library.resources.
      tags: A list of string tags passed to generated targets.
      testonly: Whether this target is intended only for tests.
      javacopts: Additional flags to pass to javac if used.
      custom_kotlincopts: Additional flags to pass to Kotlin compiler.
      disable_lint_checks: A list of AndroidLint checks to be skipped.
      transitive_configs:  Blaze feature flags (if any) on which this target depends.
      deprecation: Standard attribute, see
        https://bazel.build/reference/be/common-definitions#common.deprecation.
      features: Features enabled.
      **kwargs: Other keyword arguments.
